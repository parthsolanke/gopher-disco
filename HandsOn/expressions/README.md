ðŸ§© Problem: Expression Evaluator Without Conditionals
Write a Go program that reads two numbers from the user and performs a series of operations on them using basic arithmetic and comparison operators. The program should demonstrate the use of expressions and input/output using the fmt package.
Your program must:
* Prompt the user to input two floating-point numbers.
* Perform and display the results of:
    * Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    * Integer modulo operation (convert floats to integers first).
    * Comparison operations (equality, inequality, greater than, less than, etc.).
* Avoid all conditional statements (if, else, switch, etc.).
* Use only basic expressions and operators to compute and display results.
  Your output should be clear and formatted for readability. The focus is on using Go's expression-based evaluation, operator behavior, and standard console I/O with the fmt package.
